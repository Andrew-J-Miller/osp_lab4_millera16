file_search README

file_search is a recursize dpeth first file searching algorithm. It takes two arguements, a search term then a starting directory.

file_search <search term> <starting directory>

if the starting directory is not an absolute directory (/ at the beginning and no the end) the program will fail. It will return all files and directories that contain the search term while appending a colon to all directories for easy readability. It will also display the time the recursive search took to find the results.
